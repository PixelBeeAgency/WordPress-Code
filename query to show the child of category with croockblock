It is not easy, but possible. First of all, you need to create an Advanced query https://prnt.sc/k3XFht5oMpYs
https://crocoblock.com/knowledge-base/articles/jetengine-query-builder-sql-query-type/
SELECT second_level.term_id

FROM {prefix}term_taxonomy AS second_level

WHERE 
taxonomy = "product_cat"
   AND
parent 
   IN
( 
   SELECT first_level.term_id
   FROM {prefix}term_taxonomy AS first_level
   WHERE 
   first_level.parent = 0
)
Then create taxonomy query https://prnt.sc/UXRR8pTSdXMN
and use this tax query as a source in the filter https://prnt.sc/oeNDlnQYNxrG
